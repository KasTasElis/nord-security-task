## Possible Improvements

Overall, my testing strategy was to "cast a wide net" over my code. I rely on less but higher level tests eg. integration & e2e. Gives me max return on investment in a short amount of time.

As the app would scale, a more robust form management and validation library would make sense. eg. react-hook-forms & ZOD.
