## Possible Refactoring

While developing this app within a limited timeframe, some optimizations were made. However, there are additional improvements that could be considered:

- Restructure the server table and filtering to accommodate potential changes to the Server entity, such as adding more fields.
- For future forms, it may be beneficial to incorporate a more robust form management and validation library. One recommended option is react-hook-form combined with ZOD, especially when working with TypeScript.
