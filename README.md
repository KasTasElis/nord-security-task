## Possible Refactoring

While developing this app within a limited timeframe, some optimizations were made. However, there are additional improvements that could be considered:

- Restructure the server table and filtering to accommodate potential changes to the Server entity, such as adding more fields.
- Create resuable components like cards / table cells / buttons for reuse.
- For future forms, it may be beneficial to incorporate a more robust form management and validation library. One recommended option is react-hook-form combined with ZOD, especially when working with TypeScript.

Overall, my testing strategy under a short deadline is to "cast a wide net" over my code. Meaning I rely on higher level tests like integration and e2e. Gives us max return on investment in a short amount of time. With more time on your hands, you could create a more fine-grained test suite.
